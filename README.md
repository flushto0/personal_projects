# personal_projects
A collage of personal projects in various languages.

This is a hodge-podge of things I do in my free time. The general file structure is:  
(language)/(project_name) or 
(language)/(engine_name)/(project_name)

For anyone that would like to check out what I create, I will make executables/rc's in the top-levels of all of the project_name folders, under a folder named "build".
