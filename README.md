# mini-project collection
A collage of personal projects in various languages.

This is a hodge-podge of the smaller things I do in my free time. The general file structure is:  
(language)/(project_name) or  
(language)/$(engine_name)/(project_name)

For anyone that would like to check out what I create, I will make executables/rc's in the top-levels of all of the project_name folders, under a folder named "build" or "\_build".
